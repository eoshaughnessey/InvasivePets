# Readme
Our project is to identify which waterways in the Chicago region are likely to be areas of introduction for unwated, exotic pets and which of those species are likely to become invasive.  We are also investigation the potential impact of climate change on which species become invasive.  The end goal of this project is to present this information to the Illinois Department of Natural Resources so that they can focus on those specific areas and implement the proper control methods. 

We have two questions:
  1. Where should management agencies in the Chicago region focus sampling efforts to monitor the establishment of exotic species released from the pet trade?
 2. Does climate change have an impact on which taxa are most likely to become established?
 
 For this workshop, we have 3 goals:
 1. Develop a data management plan-of-action and database
      A. Determine what we need in our database
 2. Migrate from Google Drive to developing a progressive workflow in GitHub
 3. Learn a bit about Python
